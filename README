0. INTRODUCTION
This is a port and cleanup of my bash debugger bashdb
(http://bashdb.sf.net). 

The command syntax generally follows that of the GNU debugger gdb.

However this debugger depends on a number bug fixes and of debugging
support features that are neither part of the POSIX 1003.1 standard
and only in ksh93t+ releases. In particular, there are fixes to a
number of the .sh variables like .sh.level and .sh.file.

1. SETUP

To get the code, install git and run in a ksh shell:

  git-clone git://github.com/rocky/kshdb.git
  cd kshdb
  ./autogen.sh  # Add configure options. See ./configure --help 

If you've got a suitable ksh93t installed, then
  make && make test

To try on a real program such as perhaps /etc/profile:
  ./kshdb /etc/profile # substitute /etc/profile with your favorite ksh script

If you are happy and "make test" above worked, install via:
  sudo make install

and uninstall with 
  sudo make uninstall # ;-)

See INSTALL for generic configure installation instructions.

2. WHAT'S HERE, WHAT'S NOT and WHY NOT

What's missing falls into a two categories:

  * Stuff that can be ported in a straightforward way from bashdb
  * Stuff that needs additional ksh support

Of the things which can be ported in a straight-forward way, however
some of them I want to revise and simplify. In some cases, the fact
that ksh has associative arrays simplifies code. On other cases, the
code I wrote needs refactoring and better modularization.

Writing documentation is important, but an extensive guide will have
to wait. For now one can consult the reference guide that comes with
bashdb: http://bashdb.sf.net/bashdb.html There is some minimal help to
get a list of commands and some help for each.

3. WHAT'S NOT HERE YET IN DETAIL

3.a) Showing frame arguments, subshell nesting in the call stack

Like next, this can done with or without support from ksh, albeit
faster with help from ksh. 

3.b) Setting $0

3.c) lots of other stuff including...

  display expressions, signal handling

  None of this is rocket science. Should be pretty straight-forward to
  add.
